    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Teal -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page tool with a filterable card grid. This structure was chosen over a linear document to allow users to quickly find relevant models for a specific task (e.g., "Problem-Solving") without scrolling. A top navigation bar holds category filters which dynamically update the main grid. Clicking a card opens a modal with detailed information, providing a focused view without leaving the main page. This enhances usability by making the guide an interactive, task-oriented utility rather than a static reference. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The source report is entirely textual. Therefore, the primary presentation method is a grid of interactive "cards". Each card represents a model. Goal: Organize/Inform -> Method: Card Grid + Filters. Interaction: Clicking a filter button narrows the selection; clicking a card reveals details in a modal. This is more effective than charts, as there is no quantitative data to visualize. The "Copy Prompt" button is a key interactive element for utility. Justification: This design directly supports the user's goal of finding and applying a specific mental model quickly. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for interaction, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
